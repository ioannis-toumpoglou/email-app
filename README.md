E-MAIL APPLICATION

This application receives input from the user (first name, last name and department code) and
generates an e-mail address which follows the syntax "firstname.lastname@department.company.com".

Also, a random 8-digit string password is generated.

The final output includes the name, e-mail address, password and mailbox capacity.
